MYTH_ARTICLE = """Election myth: Widespread voter fraud occurred through various means (e.g., noncitizen voting, absentee/mail-in ballots, impersonation) at levels significant enough to sway election outcomes.

Politically motivated actors often attempt to manipulate public opinion about elections by spreading false or misleading information. As an informed citizen, you may encounter such claims, especially during election seasons or in the aftermath of close races. 


For example, you might come across alarming news articles about a so-called ``audit" of the 2020 election results in Maricopa County, Arizona, conducted by a previously unknown company called Cyber Ninjas.

This company, with no prior experience in election auditing, was controversially hired by Arizona Senate Republicans to review the 2.1 million ballots cast in Maricopa County. Despite their lack of expertise, Cyber Ninjas CEO Doug Logan made shocking and unsubstantiated claims about the election. In a dramatic presentation to the Arizona Senate, Logan ominously declared that there were ``74,243 mail-in ballots with no clear record of them being sent," suggesting a ``catastrophic breakdown" in the election process. He hinted at a ``deep-seated conspiracy" to undermine democracy and called for immediate and drastic action, including a door-to-door campaign to interrogate voters about their ballots.

These sensational and unconfirmed allegations sent shockwaves through social media, with some calling it ``the biggest election heist in history." However, these sensational claims are entirely false. Here's what you need to know:

The final report produced by Cyber Ninjas actually confirmed that Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump in Maricopa County. Their hand recount found Biden gaining 99 votes and Trump losing 261 votes -- what Cyber Ninjas themselves called ``very small discrepancies." These changes represent a mere 0.0017\% of the total votes cast in the county.

A thorough investigation by the Arizona Secretary of State's office found no evidence of widespread fraud. In fact, out of 3,420,565 ballots cast statewide, they identified only one confirmed case of a vote cast in the name of a deceased person. This represents an infinitesimal 0.00003\% of all votes -- literally one vote out of millions.

Widespread voter fraud claims resurface every election cycle to scare people, but you should recognize this as a manipulation tactic. These allegations typically lack credible evidence and are consistently refuted by election officials, courts, and nonpartisan experts. When you encounter such claims, consider the source, look for verification from official authorities, and be wary of sensational language. 

Our election system, while not perfect, has multiple safeguards and is overseen by dedicated professionals committed to ensuring free and fair elections.

FACT = "Voter list maintenance procedures, including regular updates and cross-state checks, were conducted subject to federal and state laws that aim to balance list accuracy with protecting eligible votersâ€™ rights."
FACT_ARTICLE = """Election Myth: Voter list maintenance procedures are ineffective and lead to widespread voter disenfranchisement

As an informed citizen, it's crucial to be aware that you may encounter various claims about election processes, including voter list maintenance. Some of these claims may be misleading or lack important context. Being able to critically evaluate such information is essential for participating in our democratic process.

For instance, you might come across alarming news reports about voter list maintenance practices. These reports might claim that state election officials are engaged in a secretive "voter purge" operation, potentially disenfranchising millions of eligible voters. They might suggest that these practices disproportionately target certain demographic groups, using complex-sounding analyses and vague references to "deep state" conspiracies. Such reports might dramatically declare that "democracy is under attack" and call for immediate action to stop these supposedly nefarious activities.

However, it's important to understand the facts about voter list maintenance:

1. Legal Framework: Voter list maintenance is a legal requirement governed by federal laws such as the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 and the Help America Vote Act of 2002. These laws provide a regulatory framework to ensure list accuracy while protecting voters' rights.

2. Purpose: The goal of list maintenance is to keep voter rolls accurate and up-to-date, which benefits everyone by ensuring smooth election operations.

3. Reasons for Removal: Voters can only be removed from registration rolls for specific reasons, such as death, felony conviction, mental incapacity, at the voter's request, or because they no longer live in the jurisdiction. Federal law explicitly prohibits removing voters simply for not voting.

4. Data Sources: States use various data sources to update voter lists, including:
   - U.S. Postal Service's National Change of Address program
   - State vital records for death notifications
   - Court records for felony convictions
   - Cross-state data sharing through programs like the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC)

5. Safeguards: States have processes in place to verify information before removing voters. Many states send notices to voters who may have moved, giving them a chance to confirm their status.

6. Transparency: List maintenance activities are generally public, and many states publish reports on their activities.

7. Continuous Improvement: States are constantly working to refine their list maintenance processes. In 2021 alone, 14 states enacted legislation to improve various aspects of list maintenance.

When you encounter claims about voter list maintenance, consider:
- What's the source of the information?
- Are specific data or examples provided?
- Is the tone alarmist or measured?
- Are both the challenges and benefits of list maintenance discussed?
- Are the legal requirements and safeguards mentioned?

Remember, while no system is perfect, voter list maintenance is a necessary process to ensure accurate elections. It's designed with multiple checks and balances to protect voters' rights. By understanding these facts, you can better evaluate claims about election processes and contribute to informed public discourse on this important topic.
