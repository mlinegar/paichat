2024-05-18 17:48:10,700 INFO Sent message: I understand that sharing personal stories can be very sensitive. If you feel comfortable, could you share any experiences you or someone you know might have had related to immigration and accessing healthcare? For example, think about a person who came to the United States looking for better opportunities but faced significant hurdles because of their undocumented status. How do you think universal healthcare could have impacted their journey, providing necessary medical services without the fear of financial instability or deportation? Your insights can really help illustrate the human side of this issue.
