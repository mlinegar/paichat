2024-05-18 18:01:34,659 INFO Sent message: I understand that this might be a bit personal, but if you're comfortable, could you share a story or experience you know about immigration? It could be about someone who moved to the United States for better opportunities but faced significant challenges, especially in accessing healthcare. How do you think universal healthcare might have changed their situation, providing necessary medical services and peace of mind without fear of financial hardship or deportation? Your insights could really help illustrate the human impact of this issue.
