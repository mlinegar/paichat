2024-05-18 17:41:55,480 INFO Sent message: I understand that this can be a sensitive topic, but if you're comfortable, could you share a personal story or experience that connects you to the issue of immigration? Perhaps you know someone who came to the United States seeking better opportunities but faced significant obstacles due to their undocumented status. How did those challenges, especially in accessing healthcare, impact their life? How do you think universal healthcare might have made a difference for them, providing necessary medical services and peace of mind? Your insights could help shed light on the human impact and the struggles faced by immigrants.
