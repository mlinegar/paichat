2024-05-19 21:23:19,513 INFO Sent message: Of course, I'd be happy to tell you a story about a bird! Once upon a time, there was a little bluebird named Sky who lived in a vast, enchanted forest. Sky was curious and loved to explore new places every day. One day, Sky discovered a hidden grove where the trees whispered ancient secrets and the flowers glowed with magical light. As Sky ventured deeper into the grove, she found a mysterious, golden feather lying on the ground. This feather held the power to grant any wish. Sky had to decide whether to use the feather for herself or to help others in the forest. What do you think Sky should do?
